This is a test of reading from latex.
I don't think I wanna write anything to a text doc.
Because I'll output it to a C++ file and have this read from that.\\

\newread\file
\openin\file=myfilename.txt
\loop\unless\ifeof\file
    \read\file to\fileline % Reads a line of the file into \fileline

\fileline

\repeat
\closein\file

\end{document}
